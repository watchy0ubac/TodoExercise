#Goals
Create an application that let's you accomplish a few things.

1. Add a new todo by submitting a form
2. Mark a todo as comlpeted, which crosses out the text of the todo
3. Removes a todo

#Part 2
Save the todos in localStorage, so that when you refresh the page it keeps the todos on the page there.
